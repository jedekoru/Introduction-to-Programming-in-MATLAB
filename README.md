## Description of content

This teaching package contains content for the course “Introduction to Programming in MATLAB”, consisting of the following:
1. A set of MATLAB [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) arranged by topic, to be completed over a 6-week period.
2. A set of complementary PowerPoint presentations.

The content of this package is targeted towards both undergraduate and postgraduate students who are first time/novice programmers. MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform developed by MathWorks. 

The intention of this package is to gradually introduce students to the basics of Programming in an accessible manner, providing both theoretical underpinning along with guided demonstration and practical exercises. This is made possible making use of MATLAB Live Scripts which incorporate text, visual aids as well as links to videos and other multimedia instructional content.

It is expected that students who complete this course will have been provided a sufficient foundation to delve into areas requiring intermediary and advanced programming skills using MATLAB including such as Machine Learning, Shallow Neural Networks, Deep Learning etc.

## Instructions

The course content can be approached in one of two ways:
1. By following the provided Live Scripts: Begin by opening the introductory Live Script below and follow the Live Script 
- [Week_0_Contents_and_instructions.mlx](./Week%200%20-%20Content%20and%20Instructions/Week_0_Contents_and_instructions.mlx)
2. By following the included PowerPoint presentations: Begin by opening the introductory Live Script and follow the presentation
- [Week_0_Contents_and_instructions.pptx](./Week%200%20-%20Content%20and%20Instructions/Week_0_Content_and_Instructions.pptx)

### Live Scripts

Each Live Script contains instructions that will guide you step-by-step through the set activities and exercises. 

Live scripts are divided into sections and contain Interactive Live Script Controls which include buttons, checkoxex, sliders etc. Feel free to ineract with these controls as well as typing in your own code snippets. You can run each section within a Live Script individually. 

To activate Live Script Controls, run the script manually by making use of the Run section (to run a section) or Run all sections. This will enable you to see the results. Initially, when you open a script, the Live Script controls are not active which means that you have to run the script (or section) manually to in order to see results.

There is a link to the complementary PowerPoint Presentation at the end of every Live Script.

### PowerPoint Presentations

Whenever teaching/learning is approached using the Powerpoint Presentations, a link to the complementary Live Script can be found on the last slide of every presentation.
